Empirical Analysis of RCV

This project looks at ballot data from elections across the US, Australia, Scotland, etc and attempts to compare the results via various election types like IRV, Borda, Plurality, etc. 

Example research Questions:
* For each election, do the methods of Borda, Condorcet, IRV, Bucklin, etc., choose the same winner? If not, why not? Does a method tend to choose a more centrist or fringe candidate?
* What does ``fringe'' mean?
* For each election and each method, check for the spoiler effect.
* Are there methods which disincentivize movement toward the center in some sense? Do these finding hold true if we vary voter turnout?
* etc

Documentation:
1. Folders labelled with a location ("australia", for example) have processed data. 
2. Add your questions to the tex file in the research_questions folder.
3. Add suggestions for metadata and related questions to the metadata folder.
%4. The notebooks folder has brief tutorials on github, votekit and pref_voting.
