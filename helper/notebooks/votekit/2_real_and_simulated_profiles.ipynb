This cast vote record was already cleaned by the City of Minneapolis, and they chose this way of parsing the ballots:  'undervote' indicates that the voter left a position unfilled, such as by having no candidate listed in second place. The 'overvote' notation arises when a voter puts two candidates in one position, like by putting Hodges and Samuels both in first place.  Unfortunately this way of storing the profile means we have lost any knowledge of the voter intent (which was probably to indicate equal preference). 'UWI' stands for unregistered write-in.\n",

The function `remove_noncands` will do this for us once we specify which (non)candidates to remove. If a ballot was \"A B undervote\", it will become \"A B\".

    "### Dirichlet Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dirichlet distributions** are a one-parameter family of probability distributions on the simplex---this is used here to choose a preference interval at random. We parameterize it with a value $\\alpha \\in (0,\\infty)$. As $\\alpha\\to \\infty$, the support of the distribution moves to the center of the simplex. This means we are more likely to sample preference intervals that have roughly equal support for all candidates, which will translate to all orderings being equally likely. As $\\alpha\\to 0$, the mass moves to the vertices. This means we are more likely to choose a preference interval that has strong support for a single candidate.  In between is $\\alpha=1$, where any region of the simplex is weighted in proportion to its area.  We think of this as the \"all bets are off\" setting -- you might choose a balanced preference, a concentrated preference, or something in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $\\alpha$ is never allowed to equal 0 or $\\infty$ in Python, so VoteKit changes these to a very small number ($10^{-10}$) and a very large number $(10^{20})$.  We don't recommend using values that extreme. In previous studies, MGGG members have taken $\\alpha = 1/2$ to be \"small\" and $\\alpha = 2$ to be \"big.\"\n",
